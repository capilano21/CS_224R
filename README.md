# RL with MAML and Adversarial Policy Generation

This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that combines **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** for fast adaptation across multiple tasks and **Adversarial Policy Generation** to improve the robustness of the learned policy. The aim is to build agents that can quickly adapt to new tasks while being resistant to adversarial environments.

## Introduction

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** has made great strides in solving complex decision-making problems. However, RL agents often struggle when exposed to new environments or adversarial conditions. To address this, we use **MAML** for meta-learning to enable the agent to quickly adapt to new tasks, and **adversarial policy generation** to introduce robustness during training by simulating adversarial scenarios.

The project demonstrates how:
- **MAML** enables the RL agent to adapt to new tasks with minimal updates.
- **Adversarial Policy Generation** produces adversaries that push the agent to learn more robust policies.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies:
- PyTorch
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- TensorBoard (optional)

## Usage

### Running MAML Training

To train the RL agent using MAML for task adaptation:

```bash
python experiments/maml_train.py --config configs/maml_config.yaml
```

You can customize the environment and agent settings in the `maml_config.yaml` file.

### Running Adversarial Policy Training

To train the agent with adversarial policy generation:

```bash
python experiments/adversarial_train.py --config configs/adversarial_config.yaml
```

The adversarial training framework will automatically generate adversarial environments based on the selected task.

## Training

### MAML Training

The **MAML** algorithm is used to optimize the agent so that it can quickly adapt to new tasks using only a few gradient updates. The training script applies the following steps:
1. Sample multiple tasks.
2. For each task, compute gradients for the RL agent.
3. Perform meta-updates by combining the gradients from all tasks.

### Adversarial Policy Generation

To make the agent robust, we generate adversarial policies using a competitive approach:
1. **Adversarial Policy Generator** generates agents that aim to "break" the primary agent's performance.
2. **Adversarial Training** involves having the agent train against these adversarial policies, enhancing robustness.

The adversarial environment introduces diverse obstacles and variations, forcing the agent to generalize better.

## Results

- **MAML**: The agent learns to adapt across multiple tasks after only a few gradient steps.
- **Adversarial Policy Generation**: Agents trained with adversarial policies are more resilient to unseen environments and adversarial attacks.

Graphs and logs can be visualized using TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/
```
